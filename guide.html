                <p>What exactly is a game's concept? Well it's a lot of things. The main point a
                    your concept is to give you a vision on what you want to accomplish. This may
                    include the mechanics of the game, characters, artstyle, and the goal.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    There's no real trick to coming up with a concept. You can take ideas
                    from other games and media, but it all comes down to creativity. The
                    first thing you might have your head on is the genre/artstyle. Take a minute to
                    think, even grab a piece of paper and start writing down what comes to mind.

                <p>Organization is one of the most important factors when it comes to making a
                    game. Whether it be what you plan or how you store assets, you'll need to keep
                    it organized. Trello is a free website that allows you to make to-do list for
                    pretty much anything. GitHub is useful for making backups and sharing files with
                    other developers. You can also use Google Docs to write out detailed plans and lore
                    for your game. Consider getting an external hard drive dedicated to storing your game's
                    assets- also make sure your file hierarchy has a nice organization.
